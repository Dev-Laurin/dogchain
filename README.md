A blockchain example to delve into this technology

# Blockchain 
A blockchain is a ledger for transactions. It can be 
public (bitcoin) or private (banks). 

## Proof of Work 
Bitcoin miners fight to verify a transaction 
first and once verified are rewarded with Bitcoin. 
This theoretically keeps it open and fair as
anyone can verify transactions (does Stacey have enough coin
 to do this transaction if we trace her activity all 
the way back?). However, in practice mining
becomes too expensive for an average user and 
is instead utilized by companies with big server
farms. This method doesn't scale well overtime 
and uses a lot of resources.
